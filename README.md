# Task Tracker API (In development)

## Project Description
In this project, I am developing an API that will act as the backend to the Task Tracker application. The API will be built using Python FastAPI and will have the following features: 

## Layout (To be completed)
i.e. How the API will be structured

## Testing the API
The API can be tested using the following link.

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/default
```
This link will open the Swagger UI where you can test the API endpoints.

## Project Organisation

    ├── README.md          <- The top-level README for developers using this project.
    ├── api                <- FastAPI application scripts (To be added)
    ├── data               <- Hold the sqlite database. This will be created when the API is run for the first time.
    ├── core               <- This holds the sql_db, models, schema and the crud scripts
    ├── models             <- Holds the data structures i.e linked list, stack, queue, binary tree, etc (To be added)

    ├── test               <- Unit tests for the FastAPI application
    │
    ├── views              <- This holds the html templates for the FastAPI (If you want to use it as a web app)
    │
    ├── main.py            <- FastAPI entry point
    └── requirements.txt   <- The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment, e.g.
                              generated with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
